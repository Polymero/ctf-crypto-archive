Well, howdy there, partner! You rolled in at just the right time! Now, 'round these parts, we got ourselves an old, peculiar lawâ€”says any no-good outlaw can try their hand at bestin' the sheriff in a word-guessin' game. If they win, well, they ride off scot-free. Back in the old days, losin' meant a one-way ticket to Boot Hill, but we ain't that uncivilized no more. I just rounded up a whole gang of low-down bandits, and their day in court's comin' up fast. We can't have any of 'em slippin' through the cracks. So, what do ya say? You fixin' to help me keep this town safe?
